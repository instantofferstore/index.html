								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is AirSelfie?</h2>
<p>AirSelfie is the world’s smallest portable flying camera. Who said selfies were confined to sticks? With this groundbreaking device, you’ll be able to snap aerial photos directly from your phone. Sky’s the limit.</p>
<p>AirSelfie is a registered trademark and all its components are protected by filed and granted patents.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-194 aligncenter" src="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/e3455848c02b523242a2c156af163601_original.gif" alt="" width="680" height="383" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Take AirSelfie out of its cover and launch it from your phone using the AirSelfie app available for iOS and Android.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-193 aligncenter" src="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/272021842a155b048807a84f1a440883_original.gif" alt="" width="680" height="383" /></p>
<p>Fly AirSelfie and control it directly through 3 different flight functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Selfie mode</b>, the easiest one, with just two directional buttons to make AirSelfie move far or close to you.</li>
<li><b>Selfie Motion Control mode</b>, control AirSelfie in real time with the virtual joystick provided by App.</li>
<li><b>Flying mode</b>, where the device is held horizontally and replaces a classic controller. Once you’ve found the perfect positioning for the shot, AirSelfie stays still, thanks to the hovering function.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-195 aligncenter" src="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ee8bddbe8193e91b2b33ad5b5e63388c_original.gif" alt="" width="680" height="383" /></p>
<p>Land AirSelfie onto your open hand and place it back in its case where it will be <b>recharged.</b></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-196 aligncenter" src="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original.png" alt="" width="680" height="371" srcset="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original.png 680w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original-599x327.png 599w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original-300x164.png 300w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original-768x419.png 768w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original-1024x559.png 1024w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6403f73ab3bca629482568efbd292c5c_original-788x429.png 788w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The pics will be immediately downloaded to your mobile device via wifi, ready to be shared through your favorite social media platform.</p>
<h2>Why AirSelfie?</h2>
<p>How many times have you found yourself trying to fit twenty people or more in that group selfie? How many times have you tried squeezing in that beautiful sunset in your couple selfie? And how many times have you had to cut out that landmark while snapping one simple selfie?</p>
<p><b>Say goodbye to your selfie stick or stretching your arm out till it hurts.</b></p>
<p>You can place AirSelfie in its designated phone cover (which acts as a charger too) and unchain it whenever you want to take an aerial picture or video.</p>
<p><b>Imagine being able to revolutionize perspective completely.</b></p>
<p>Fly AirSelfie &#8211; micro-device HD camera &#8211; comfortably from your phone, by using the AirSelfie App and take the most amazing selfies. AirSelfie is compatible with all iOS and Android Operative Systems.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to build unforgettable memories through a new perspective.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DJI is working on a “local data mode” for its apps that prevents any data from being sent to or received from the internet. The feature will be welcomed by many, but it’s hard not to attribute the timing and urgency of the announcement to the recent ban of DJI gear by the U.S. Army over unspecified “cyber vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>“We are creating local data mode to address the needs of our enterprise customers, including public and private organizations that are using DJI technology to perform sensitive operations around the world,” said Brendan Schulman, the company’s VP of Policy and Legal Affairs, in a press release. The new feature should arrive before the end of September.</p>
<p>The Army memo, first published at Small UAS News and dated August 2, said that “due to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products, it is directed that the U.S. Army halt use of all DJI products.”</p>
<p>It’s not clear what these vulnerabilities actually are, or whether the mere possibility of sensitive information being transmitted was enough to spook someone at HQ.</p>
<p><img src="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="582" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143" srcset="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land.jpg 866w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land-600x403.jpg 600w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land-300x202.jpg 300w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land-768x516.jpg 768w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dji-phantom-3-pro-drone-app-auto-land-788x529.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px" /></p>
<p>DJI’s flight control apps, from which users can launch and control drones, does indeed regularly phone home to make sure it is up to date, using current maps and so on. And if the user chose to, it would back-up flight logs and media to DJI’s servers. But the online functions aren’t necessary for ordinary operation and flight, so local data mode doesn’t affect airworthiness or anything like that.</p>
<p>Although DJI was not made aware of the Army’s concerns ahead of time, the new mode has been in development for several months, according to the press release. So either a little bird told the company this was a possibility, or more likely it’s just a smart option to include when your craft and apps are being put into national security and life-and-death type situations.</p>
<p>A DJI representative told TechCrunch that today’s announcement isn’t in response to the memo. Schulman, however, told The New York Times that “the Army memo caused customers to express renewed concern about data security.”</p>
<p>These statements may seem contradictory, but it’s not hard to imagine that when a major client like the Army raises security concerns, others will join the chorus. So DJI can say the announcement today wasn’t in response to the memo — not directly, anyway. But chances are we wouldn’t be hearing about the feature until later had the memo not been publicized.</p>
<p>“We’re not responding to the Army, which has never explained its concerns to us,” explained Adam Lisberg, DJI’s corporate comms director for North America, in response to my inquiries along these lines. “We’re accelerating the rollout of something we’ve been working on for a while. We announced it today because enterprise customers with serious data security have made clear they need something like this for a while, and the Army memo reinforced that concern for them. So we’re addressing it quickly as part of our commitment to delivering what our enterprise customers need.”</p>
<p>It matters because DJI isn’t a military-specific drone maker, like General Atomics, which makes Predators — though the chances of a Chinese company ever being so are slim, to say the least. It’s also a matter of public image: they’re a company looking out for consumers and the occasional government contract, not a major participator in the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Clearly, the company wants to signal that it takes its feature requests not from foreign governments, but from its valued users all over the globe, of which the Army happens to be one.</p>

The world&#8217;s best-selling drone-maker is adding a privacy mode to its aircraft to prevent flight data being shared to the internet.

			</div></div><span id="more-4"></span></p>
<p>The announcement comes a fortnight after it emerged that the US Army had prohibited its troops from using the Chinese firm&#8217;s equipment because of unspecified cyber-security concerns.<br />
DJI told the BBC that it had already been working on the new facility, but had speeded up development after the ban.</p>
<p><em>The mode should be launched next month.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;It will provide an enhanced level of data assurance for security flights, such as those involving critical infrastructure, commercial trade secrets, governmental functions or other similar options,&#8221; the Shenzhen-headquartered company added in a blog.</p>
<h2>Disabled features</h2>
<p>DJI previously faced security fears in 2016 after a member of its staff told reporters that the firm had repeatedly shared customer data with the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>The company issued a clarification shortly afterwards, saying a junior member of its team had &#8220;misspoke&#8221; and that it only handed over information if there was a valid legal request from Beijing or any other government.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75 size-full" src="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="351" srcset="https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc.jpg 624w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc-599x337.jpg 599w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc-300x169.jpg 300w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc-768x432.jpg 768w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://myinstantoffer.store/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/377288d9-1ba8-48c3-8c10-9594756efdfc-788x443.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DJI says it is unable to collect flight logs or captured images anyway, unless users opt to share the information via its Go apps, which are used to track and control its aircraft.</p>
<p>But the latest move is designed to provide further reassurance.</p>
<p>If the privacy mode is enabled, however, users will lose access to several features including the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>livestream videos to YouTube</li>
<li>automatically install map and geofencing boundary updates, which are designed to prevent owners flying within banned zones</li>
<li>receive notifications about newly issued flight restrictions from the authorities</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, DJI said it might not be able offer the new mode in countries where pilots are required by law to have the latest information.</p>
<h2>New memo</h2>
<p>The US armed forces decided in July that using DJI&#8217;s drones posed &#8220;operational risks&#8221;, leading the US Army to detail its ban on 2 August.</p>
<p>The memo said that its use of the aircraft should cease, all DJI apps should be uninstalled from its computers and that all batteries and storage media should be removed from the drones while they were kept in storage.<br />
However, the SUAS news site &#8211; which was the first to reveal the development &#8211; has since reported on a follow-up memo dated 11 August.</p>
<p>It indicates the army will grant exceptions to the ban once a DJI plug-in to its own drone software has been properly vetted.</p>
