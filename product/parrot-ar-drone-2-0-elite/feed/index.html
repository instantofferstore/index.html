					<description><![CDATA[Enjoyable. Its not worth the price which is why I only gave 3/5 on the review. I do though enjoy my drone. I bought it a year and a half ago and it still works just fine. The indoor housing unit is horrible, it breaks way to easy so i&#039;m constantly using electric tape to try and fix it. All in all it is fun for me and it is my very first drone. Also battery life is just horrible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Worst drone ever. I purchased this items about 2-3 years ago. Used it about 3 times only to fly around the house. Today I went to go use it and it did not work at all. I figured my battery was dead because I haven&#039;t used it in a long time. I went to go charge my battery, but it won&#039;t charge. No light turned on the charger or anything. So I just want to know how can this break when I have only used it 3 times.]]></description>
