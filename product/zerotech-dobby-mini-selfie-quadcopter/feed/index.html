					<description><![CDATA[Nice product, instructions lack detail. The little thing flies very nice, takes great pictures, very stable. Battery life is very short for the size of the drone vs the size of the battery, It is a heavy little drone for sure. the props are small as well. This adds up to a big power drain to keep it flying. But it also adds up to a compact feature packed product. I was not very happy with the vendor this drone ships from, many things make me wary of doing any new business with them. One thing is I never trust ant tech stuff shipped from Brooklyn NY. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well Made disappointment. I don&#039;t know why they made it so complicated. It takes too long to sync with the firmware. The drone says the battery is low once you finally get it in the air and it wants too land. When you turn it off and on again it shows you it has plenty of battery life. It seemed to work well before the 2nd firmware download. Or maybe it&#039;s the battery. In any case it is quite an expensive lesson in disappointment.]]></description>
