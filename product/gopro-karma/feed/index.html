					<description><![CDATA[This Karma drone is unreal. I have never flown a drone before and I was a little frightened because on every thing I&#039;ve read 80% of drones have crashed one or more times. I found a big field to start with and no wind. I let it take off by its self being a little afraid of doing myself. With the hand hold controller I could do no wrong it seemed like, it was so easy. That controller is worth its weight in gold its so easy to use. That was one of my reasons for getting a Karma, you don&#039;t NEED a smart phone. Although I did hook up my iPhone to the drone and my helper used it to take pictures while I flew it. Out of the box without changing any settings it took beautiful movies jitter free and even better photos. The only thing I added was a polarizer, it protects the lens and gives you a beautiful full deep color picture. The second time I took it out to fly there was gusty winds of 5 to 15mph and in movie mode which you can change anytime from photo mode the drone held its place and didn&#039;t move a inch. You could hear the motors picking up speed when a gust came.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are no Pros with this drone. That is a shame on GoPro.

I bought the Karma via Best Buy initially thinking of just getting the Grip. But heck for $500 more why not get drone with it. I played with the Karma for 3 months. Took it to Mexico, flew it around all over my hometown here in US. I thought it was good in that its a complete package for the GoPro users. You want aerial vids, you got the karma. You want ground vids, you got the grip. Life was alright with the Karma for the 3 months, until I tried the DJI Mavic Pro and realized life was much much greener on the other side.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, let me clarify something. The official safe maximum range on the Karma drone is 3200 ish feet. However, there is a setting in the Karma remote that allows you to disable the &quot;safe&quot; distance option.

I have personally flown the Karma successfully about 5600 feet (a mile is 5280 feet) before it decided to automatically return to the take-off point. And by the way, it was very cool to see it autopilot itself the entire way back to me. Once the drone is back in range there is an option on the remote to regain control.

The Karma drone package is by far the best deal for the majority of people. For $1100, you get the drone itself, battery, backpack, gopro hero 5 black camera ($399 value), gopro stabilizing stick (actually very cool in and of itself, $299 value), and a few other attachments.]]></description>
