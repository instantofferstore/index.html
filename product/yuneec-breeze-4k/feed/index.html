					<description><![CDATA[Sir Crash A Lot! I was trying to get a feel for the basics of the drone on its first flight and then the drone suddenly shot straight into the sky at full speed and out of wifi control. It was the out of eye sight for three to five minutes and then came in for a slow decent and landed in a field owned by a major petroleum distributor. I regained visual and wifi connection as the drone was attempting to land but could not because the grass was too tall. I never regained flight control. The drone kept hovering in the tall grass until the battery died. I contacted the companies security and after a few hoops they retrieved the drone for me and now the blades are damaged by stiff grass. Also one of the blade protectors is now missing in the field. This was the first five minutes in my experience with this drone.]]></description>
