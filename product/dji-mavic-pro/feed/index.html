					<description><![CDATA[amazing drone. I brought this from sams in may. I have flown it over 30 hours and over 100 flights. I update every firmware. I never calibrated anything. Its been a flawless product so far. Amazing long list of things it can do. When i ask it to return to me on its own called RTH
(return to home). It lands by itself within an inch from where it took off and recorded HOME. I did buy the goggles   It took awhile for me to get use to them and get a true 1080p out of it but I always use the goggles now   
The drone is a keeper too. Just read the manual and use beginner in the app and fly their simulator in the app as well.  Read about FAA rules and comply. Have fun. You will]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Marvelous Mavic. Many drone pilots are wondering if the Mavic Pro will cannibalize sales of the Phantom 4. This is a VERY capable drone with a very good camera and gimbal. The app had its moments right when I first got it, but has become a lot more stable with the last two updates.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a thrill! The Mavic is a great drone whether your are a beginner or expert pilot. It is small and compact which makes it a breeze to transport to any location. The camera takes great photos and video up to 4k. The seller is awesome and I would recommend buying from them.]]></description>
