								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="common-content">The Inspire 1 was a revelation&#8230;</h2>
<p class="common-content">The first filmmaking drone in the world to integrate an HD video transmission system, 360° rotating gimbal, and a 4K camera, as well as the simplicity of app control. The launches of the Zenmuse X5 and X5R cameras further cemented the Inspire as a critical tool for filmmakers around the globe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Image quality, power, and intelligence to meet the needs of professional filmmakers and enterprizes around the globe.</p></blockquote>
<p class="common-content">The Inspire 2 takes everything that was good about the Inspire 1 and improves it. An all-new image processing system records at up to 5.2K in CinemaDNG RAW, Apple ProRes and more. It goes from 0 to 50mph (80kph) in just 5 seconds and hits a maximum speed of 58mph (94kph) and has a max descent speed of 9m/sfor unheard of speed and agility in an aircraft this size. A dual battery system prolongs the flight time to a maximum of 27 minutes (with an X4S), while self-heating technology allows it to fly even in low temperatures. FlightAutonomy has been revised and developed specifically for the Inspire 2, providing two directions of obstacle avoidance and sensor redundancy. Increased intelligence adds multiple intelligent flight modes, including Spotlight Pro, giving even single pilots the ability to create complex, dramatic shots. An upgraded video transmission system is now capable of dual signal frequency and dual channel, streaming video from an onboard FPV camera and the main camera simultaneously, for better pilot and camera operator collaboration.</p>

<h3>Professional image quality</h3>
<p>Integrated into the Inspire 2 is the brand new CineCore 2.0 image processing system, capable of recording 5.2K videos in CinemaDNG, Apple ProRes and more. CineCore 2.0 is built into the aircraft nose and works with any camera connected through the dedicated gimbal port.</p>
<h3>Intelligent flight modes</h3>
<p>In addition to Spotlight Pro, a range of other intelligent flight and shooting modes are available. Obstacle avoidance is optimized when using Point of Interest and Waypoint modes, making complex shots simple and repeatable. Also available are QuickSpin, TapFly and ActiveTrack, to simplify challenging shots.</p>
<h3>Video transmission system</h3>
<p>The latest update to DJI Lightbridge technology has an effective transmission distance of up to 4.3mi (7km) and is capable of delivering both 1080p/720p video as well as the FPV view to pilot and camera operator. Users can also switch between 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz control frequencies to cut through noise for greater signal stability.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Advanced, ready-to-fly design</h2>
<blockquote><p>Imagine holding the future in your hands. Designed to be powerful while lightweight, flexible while providing the stability you need, the Inspire 1 is DJI’s most advanced complete package. All of the latest aerial technology is packed into one simple, ready-to-fly system, putting you in the sky within minutes.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Aerodynamic, transforming design</h3>
<p>Carbon fiber arms give you the strength to maneuver in the air and they transform, moving out of the camera’s way at the flick of a switch. With a full 360⁰ unobstructed view, you now have the freedom to capture shots independent of the direction you are flying.</p>
<h3>Rotor design</h3>
<p>The all new 13 inch quick release rotors are built with the unique DJI &#8220;Z-Blade&#8221; design. They have been reinforced with a new carbon fiber compound material to ensure excellent performance with increased stability.</p>
<h3>Positioning</h3>
<p>As it flies, the position of your Inspire 1 is constantly updated and recorded using a high-strength, intelligent GLONASS + GPS system. This dual positioning system enables higher precision and quicker satellite acquisition, allowing you to see where the aircraft is on a live map and giving it a point to hover at when you release the controls.</p>
<h3>Failsafe</h3>
<p>All of these features combine to put your Inspire 1 on autopilot when needed. If the battery runs low or connection with your remote controller is lost, the Inspire 1 uses its positioning system and smart flight technology to return back to you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dji Phantom 4 Pro is</h2>
<blockquote><p>An uprated camera is equipped with a 1-inch 20-megapixel sensor capable of shooting 4K/60fps video and Burst Mode stills at 14 fps.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Camera with 1-inch 20mp sensor</h3>
<p>The onboard camera has been redesigned to use a 1-inch 20-megapixel CMOS sensor. A custom engineered lens made up of eight elements is arranged in seven groups, it is the first DJI camera to use a mechanical shutter, eliminating rolling shutter distortion which can occur when taking images of fast moving subjects or when flying at high speed. In effect, it is as powerful as many traditional ground cameras. More powerful video processing supports H.264 4K videos at 60fps or H.265 4K at 30fps, both with a 100Mbps bitrate. Advanced sensors and processors<br />
ensure everything is captured with more image detail and the image data needed for advanced post-production.</p>
<h3>5-direction of obstacle sensing</h3>
<p>FlightAutonomy is expanded with an additional set of high-resolution stereo vision sensors placed at the rear in addition to the pair placed on the front as well as infrared sensing systems placed on the left and right sides. This network creates a total of 5-direction of obstacle sensing and 4-direction of obstacle avoidance, protecting the Phantom 4 Pro from more obstacles and giving filmmakers the confidence to capture more complex images.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is the DJI Mavic Pro?</h2>
<p>The DJI Mavic Pro is a small yet powerful drone that turns the sky into your creative canvas easily and without worry,helping you make every moment an aerial moment. Its compact size hides a high degree of complexity that makes it one of DJI’s mostsophisticated flying cameras ever. 24 high-performance computing cores, an all-new transmission system with a 4.3mi (7km) *range,5 vision sensors, and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal, are at your commandwith just a push of your thumb or a tap of your finger.*Unobstructed, free of interference, when FCC compliant.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mavic Pro is the smallest camera-equipped quadcopter in DJI’s drone line-up.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Fly further</h3>
<p>Inside the Mavic’s pocket-sized remote controller is DJI’s brand new OcuSync transmission technology, with a range of 4.3mi (7km)*, HD 720p long range and Full HD 1080p short range video streaming.</p>
<h3>No bumps and scrapes</h3>
<p>An unprotected drone could hit obstacles during long distance flight or when descending from an inadequate height in Return to Home mode. The Mavic uses FlightAutonomy technology to sense obstacles up to 49ft (15m) away and allows the Mavic to bypass them or brake to hover, reducing accidents.</p>
<h3>4K Ultra HD video</h3>
<p>Mavic supports 4K video at 30fps. No Electronic Image Stabilization is used, ensuring all footage is 4K. We have created a miniaturized, ultra-precise 3-axis gimbal for the Mavic, capable of stabilizing the camera even during high-speed motion for smooth video and sharp photos.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Priced at $999, the Mavic Pro weighs just 743g and, when folded down, measures only 83 x 83 x 198mm – more than compact enough to slip into a small bag. It comes with a battery delivering around 27 minutes of flight per charge, plus it has a top speed of some 65km/h, a 12MP camera mounted on a 3-axis gimbal, and a compact remote control that works in tandem with your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.</p>
