					<description><![CDATA[This Karma drone is unreal. I have never flown a drone before and I was a little frightened because on every thing I&#039;ve read 80% of drones have crashed one or more times. I found a big field to start with and no wind. I let it take off by its self being a little afraid of doing myself. With the hand hold controller I could do no wrong it seemed like, it was so easy. That controller is worth its weight in gold its so easy to use. That was one of my reasons for getting a Karma, you don&#039;t NEED a smart phone. Although I did hook up my iPhone to the drone and my helper used it to take pictures while I flew it. Out of the box without changing any settings it took beautiful movies jitter free and even better photos. The only thing I added was a polarizer, it protects the lens and gives you a beautiful full deep color picture. The second time I took it out to fly there was gusty winds of 5 to 15mph and in movie mode which you can change anytime from photo mode the drone held its place and didn&#039;t move a inch. You could hear the motors picking up speed when a gust came.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are no Pros with this drone. That is a shame on GoPro.

I bought the Karma via Best Buy initially thinking of just getting the Grip. But heck for $500 more why not get drone with it. I played with the Karma for 3 months. Took it to Mexico, flew it around all over my hometown here in US. I thought it was good in that its a complete package for the GoPro users. You want aerial vids, you got the karma. You want ground vids, you got the grip. Life was alright with the Karma for the 3 months, until I tried the DJI Mavic Pro and realized life was much much greener on the other side.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, let me clarify something. The official safe maximum range on the Karma drone is 3200 ish feet. However, there is a setting in the Karma remote that allows you to disable the &quot;safe&quot; distance option.

I have personally flown the Karma successfully about 5600 feet (a mile is 5280 feet) before it decided to automatically return to the take-off point. And by the way, it was very cool to see it autopilot itself the entire way back to me. Once the drone is back in range there is an option on the remote to regain control.

The Karma drone package is by far the best deal for the majority of people. For $1100, you get the drone itself, battery, backpack, gopro hero 5 black camera ($399 value), gopro stabilizing stick (actually very cool in and of itself, $299 value), and a few other attachments.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[amazing drone. I brought this from sams in may. I have flown it over 30 hours and over 100 flights. I update every firmware. I never calibrated anything. Its been a flawless product so far. Amazing long list of things it can do. When i ask it to return to me on its own called RTH
(return to home). It lands by itself within an inch from where it took off and recorded HOME. I did buy the goggles   It took awhile for me to get use to them and get a true 1080p out of it but I always use the goggles now   
The drone is a keeper too. Just read the manual and use beginner in the app and fly their simulator in the app as well.  Read about FAA rules and comply. Have fun. You will]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[okay condition. when i received the phone i noticed a few dents in the back and scratches on the front screen. there is also internal damage involving sensors which i am not happy about. although the price is fair enough since it is majorly reduced, i will need repairs to have it fully and entirely functional. i will most likely not be buying from this company again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Enjoyable. Its not worth the price which is why I only gave 3/5 on the review. I do though enjoy my drone. I bought it a year and a half ago and it still works just fine. The indoor housing unit is horrible, it breaks way to easy so i&#039;m constantly using electric tape to try and fix it. All in all it is fun for me and it is my very first drone. Also battery life is just horrible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sir Crash A Lot! I was trying to get a feel for the basics of the drone on its first flight and then the drone suddenly shot straight into the sky at full speed and out of wifi control. It was the out of eye sight for three to five minutes and then came in for a slow decent and landed in a field owned by a major petroleum distributor. I regained visual and wifi connection as the drone was attempting to land but could not because the grass was too tall. I never regained flight control. The drone kept hovering in the tall grass until the battery died. I contacted the companies security and after a few hoops they retrieved the drone for me and now the blades are damaged by stiff grass. Also one of the blade protectors is now missing in the field. This was the first five minutes in my experience with this drone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Worst drone ever. I purchased this items about 2-3 years ago. Used it about 3 times only to fly around the house. Today I went to go use it and it did not work at all. I figured my battery was dead because I haven&#039;t used it in a long time. I went to go charge my battery, but it won&#039;t charge. No light turned on the charger or anything. So I just want to know how can this break when I have only used it 3 times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a thrill! The Mavic is a great drone whether your are a beginner or expert pilot. It is small and compact which makes it a breeze to transport to any location. The camera takes great photos and video up to 4k. The seller is awesome and I would recommend buying from them.]]></description>
